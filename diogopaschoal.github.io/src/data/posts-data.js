  '20260202-ai-tools-usage': '<p>We are in the fourth technological revolution: the era of AI. Between fear and excitement, a wide range of AI tools, platforms, pricing tiers, and opportunities are now available.</p>\n<p>I remember the internet boom around 2000: home computers and access to the web became far cheaper, and bandwidth grew to speeds that once belonged only to universities. AI itself is not new, but recent, accessible chat platforms and powerful engines have moved it from a niche research topic to an everyday tool — adopted faster and more broadly than many expected.</p>\n<p>That shift highlights an important distinction: inclusion versus education. Digital inclusion means making technology available and affordable. Education means learning to use that technology well — to understand it, to shape how it’s used, and to apply it productively.</p>\n<p>Availability alone does not guarantee good use. Long before we learned to control fire, people burned themselves trying to cook; access is only the first step. Similarly, making AI widely available doesn’t automatically teach people how to use it responsibly or effectively.</p>\n<p>When new technologies change labor needs, jobs evolve rather than simply disappear. The transition from hunting to agriculture shifted labour and created new roles; people who learned the new skills found opportunities. The same will be true with AI: those who practice, learn, and adopt AI tools will be better positioned in the changing workforce.</p>\n<p>So this is not a call to fear the technology, but to be empowered by it. Learn how AI works, experiment with tools, and shape your own path instead of letting others decide it for you.</p>\n',
  '20260202-hello-world': '<p>I decided to create a blog area where I can post my learnings, thoughts and feelings about my work, my areas of interest and anything that I feel interesting.</p>\n<p>At the moment, I started this being 40 years old, some experience in software development and a lot of mistakes on this road till here as expected from a human being.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ll try to make daily posts and be available for conversation in any channels that I have. I&#39;m not a social network guy and I usually talk with people on my work or in the world out of the screens.</p>\n<p>For this first one, I&#39;m inspired by my journey to self awareness and mindfulness. It is not about hapiness, it is about to be present and aware of yourself, it is about to reconnect with your inner identity and use it so intensely that you do not distinguish yesterday, tomorrow and now. Everything is impermanent and the only thing that matter is the percepection of the current moment.</p>\n<p>This blog will try to materialize this feeling and put into words anything that I lerned in my day.</p>\n',
