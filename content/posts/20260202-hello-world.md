# Hello World

I decided to create a blog area where I can post my learnings, thoughts and feelings about my work, my areas of interest and anything that I feel interesting.

At the moment, I started this being 40 years old, some experience in software development and a lot of mistakes on this road till here as expected from a human being.

I'll try to make daily posts and be available for conversation in any channels that I have. I'm not a social network guy and I usually talk with people on my work or in the world out of the screens.

For this first one, I'm inspired by my journey to self awareness and mindfulness. It is not about hapiness, it is about to be present and aware of yourself, it is about to reconnect with your inner identity and use it so intensely that you do not distinguish yesterday, tomorrow and now. Everything is impermanent and the only thing that matter is the percepection of the current moment.

This blog will try to materialize this feeling and put into words anything that I lerned in my day.
